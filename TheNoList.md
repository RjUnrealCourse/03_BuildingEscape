Things that I feel like adding in, but if I do will take out the next few years of my game building career

## NO LIST
* No power ups, upgrades, one ups or health additions
* No finding new ammo, so No finite ammo
* No walking / humanoid opponents
* No huge landscape maps
* No third person camera
* No third person body animations, third person body exists to just take damage in our current gameplay
* No picture perfect buildings
* No super perfect touchups that take a day for an object / asset
* Definitely no grass and trees until the end, they kill build times
*
